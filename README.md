# Getting Started with Running the App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn` or `npm i` if you don't have yarn to install the dependencies of the project.

then upon doing that, you can then run

### `yarn start`

OR

### `npm run start`

to start the project.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

and you may start playing around with it.

### Happy Testing
